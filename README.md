### Run Jekyll on your computer to speed up testing

* Install the [requirements for Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).
* Type `bundle install` at the root of your project to install the necessary Ruby dependencies.
* Type `bundle exec jekyll serve` to launch the test Jekyll web server that will re-compile your work if you edit it.
* You can then open `http://localhost:4000` in your web browser to see your work-in-progress website.
